# EDA of Netflix 2020 Dataset in Elixir

This is the Elixir version of another repo of mine (https://github.com/llrt/eda-netflix-2020-jl), which itself was a loosely inspired port of [great EDA of Netflix 2020 Dataset in R by ygterl](https://github.com/ygterl/EDA-Netflix-2020-in-R)  to Julia. 

The idea here is to learn Elixir, Livebook and Nx-ecosystem libraries

## Libraries/tools used

- **Livebook**: Elixir's "jupyter notebooks"
- **Explorer**: for data frame manipularion, much inspired by R's dplyr
- **Vega-lite / Tucan**: for charting
